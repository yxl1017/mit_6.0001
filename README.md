# MIT 6.0001 OpenCourseWare

My solutions to the 5 problem sets in this open course (taken in Feb 2023), cannot guarentee the correctness. In fact, I remember I did not get ps2 completey right, planning to go back and fix it when I got more comfortable with the Python language, but haven't bothered to go back to fix it.
